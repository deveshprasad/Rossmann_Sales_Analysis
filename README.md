# Rossmann Sales Analysis

This project is mainly concerned with data pre-processing for a sales
forecasting problem across different stores in the retail industry. The task involves the
analysis of historical sales data collected from a large drug store chain in Europe
(Rossmann chain in Germany). The aim is to expose you to a realistic business case
and to gain understanding and insight about some of the ways in which data can be
fully prepared to optimise its analytical value.


## Description of the business context
Accurately forecasting sales is one of the most difficult challenges faced by retailers
worldwide, as sales are influenced by many factors, such as promotions, competition,
holidays, seasonality and locality. In this project, the overall business objective is to
predict 6 weeks of daily sales for 1,115 drug stores located across Germany, as
reliable sales forecasts enable store managers to increase the overall productivity and
profitability of the retail business and improve their customer satisfaction.
However, the challenges in this sales forecasting problem are to take into account
various types of factors and to deal with missing data from historical records. Thus,
you are commissioned to get the historical dataset fully pre-processed for reliable and
accurate forecasting, and the major data preparation tasks, like integration,
visualisation, cleaning and transformation, should be explored. The available datasets
are briefly introduced below.
